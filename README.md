# Dev Container Features Catalog

This repository hosts a curated set of Dev Container Features under `src/` with matching smoke tests in `test/`. Each feature packages tooling or services that can be layered into a dev container image.

## Repo Layout
- `src/<feature>/` — feature manifest (`devcontainer-feature.json`), installation script, and supporting assets.
- `test/<feature>/` — autogenerated checks plus optional scenario scripts that mirror each feature.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI pipelines for linting, testing, and publishing features.

## Local Development
1. Install the Dev Containers CLI if you have not already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
   ```
2. Run targeted tests while iterating on a feature:
   ```bash
   devcontainer features test --skip-scenarios -f <feature> -i debian:latest .
   ```
3. Execute the feature scenarios when you change scripts, tests, or shared helpers:
   ```bash
   devcontainer features test -f <feature> --skip-autogenerated .
   ```
4. Run the global scenarios only when a change affects shared behavior:
   ```bash
   devcontainer features test --global-scenarios-only .
   ```

## Generating Feature Docs
Regenerate documentation after modifying anything under `src/` (including new features):
```bash
devcontainer features generate-docs -p src -n itsmechlark/features --github-owner itsmechlark --github-repo features
```
Review the resulting `src/<feature>/README.md` files and commit them alongside your changes.

## Contributing
- Set new feature versions to `0.0.0`; release automation manages subsequent bumps.
- Add new features to `.release-please-manifest.json` and `release-please-config.json`.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` files untouched—release automation updates them.
- Ensure shell scripts remain executable and follow the existing helper conventions.

Refer to `Agents.md` for the full contributor checklist and detailed automation guidance.
